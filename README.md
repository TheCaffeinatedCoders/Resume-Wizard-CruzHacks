### RESUME WIZARD ###
## Inspiration
Our inspiration for this project was wanting to make a more equitable way for people to easily create beautiful resumes and get jobs easier.

## What it does
Our website uses AI to enhance the users answers to regular resume questions and builds a resume for them using latex and one of a couple templates.

## How we built it
We used python to write the backend for getting openai api calls for the user inputs, and a javascript website for building the frontend that the user sees and interacts with. The frontend sends certain user inputs to the backend in order to enhance them with AI. Then at the end, it allows the user to save the latex text of the resume which was auto-generated for them.

## Challenges we ran into
We had a lot of trouble settling on an idea at first. Another large challenge we ran into was we wanted to allow the user to directly download a pdf version of the final resume, but we ended up having to scrap this idea due to time and the difficulties that python has implementing this functionality.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of our website altogether. We believe that our idea can truly be powerful if implemented correctly and has the potential to make a lasting difference on dozens of users. We are very proud of our successful implementation of an AI related app, and in terms of the frontend structure, the single page website app is something else that really stood out to us as a great testament to our skill and commitment.

## What we learned
We learned how powerful AI is. We learned that converting a format of the document work is not as easy as we thought. We put too much faith into the functionality of the libraries that we chose to utilize, which led to overlooking the process of converting Latex to PDF using Python.

## What's next for ResumeWizard
We have a lto of components that we want to improve for Resume Wizard. First, we wish to have each seciton to be added and allow the user to dynamically edit the quantity and content of each individual section on the resume. Furthermore, we want to build the program with the capability to conver the Latex format to a PDF to create a more convenient experience for the user.
